App Name: Token Buyback Monitor

Description:
Token Buyback Monitor is a Mini App that tracks real-time and scheduled token buyback programs across crypto projects. Follow official buyback announcements, monitor on-chain buyback transactions, and receive alerts when a protocol starts or increases its buyback activity. This helps users identify potential bullish signals and understand how supply reduction may impact token value.

Key Features:
 • Real-time monitoring of token buyback transactions
 • Alerts for new or updated buyback program announcements
 • Tracking across multiple blockchains and major DeFi protocols
 • Historical data on previous buybacks and their market impact
 • Dashboard to follow selected tokens and compare buyback intensity

Use Case:
Ideal for traders, analysts, and long-term investors who want to track supply-reducing events, detect bullish momentum, and make better investment decisions based on buyback activity.

Please add the file `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can update the title and description. Once that file is added, I’ll also create the new `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` file for the app logo.
